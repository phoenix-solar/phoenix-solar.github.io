# Phoenix Solar Documentation


## Who?
We (Patrick and Leo) are two dudes who spend their time tinkering with electronics, drones and mechanical engineering in general. 

## What?
On this webpage we want to document our projects primarily for us and for everyone who's interested in what we do.

## Why?
We initially created this webpage to document the development process of our solar plane, but then decided to also use this page to
document other projects.
